We only read the data you explicitly upload, and you can delete everything at any time. We're more secure than most banks' own mobile apps.

**Q: Do you sell my financial information?**

**Q: What happens to my data if I cancel?**
A: You maintain complete control. When you cancel, you can download all your data, and we'll permanently delete everything from our servers within 30 days. No hidden retention, no backup copies ‚Äì it's completely gone.

**Pricing & Plans**

A: Yes, completely free for 30 days with no credit card required. You get full access to all Pro features, unlimited uploads, and AI insights. If you don't love it, simply don't upgrade ‚Äì no charges, no hassles.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Absolutely. Cancel with one click from your account settings. No phone calls, no retention specialists, no hoops to jump through. If you cancel a paid plan, you'll continue to have access until your current billing period ends.

**Q: What's the difference between Free and Pro plans?**
A: The free plan includes 5 document uploads per month and basic insights. Pro gives you unlimited uploads, advanced AI analysis, goal tracking, custom reports, and priority support. Most users upgrade within the first week because the insights are so valuable.

A: Our AI achieves 95%+ accuracy on transaction categorization, and it learns from your corrections to get even better. You can always adjust categories, and the AI remembers your preferences for future transactions.

**Q: Can I connect my bank accounts directly?**
A: Currently, we focus on document uploads for maximum security and user control. Direct bank connections are on our roadmap for 2024, but many users prefer the upload method because it gives them complete control over what data is shared.

**Technical Support**

**Q: What if I need help getting started?**
A: We offer multiple support channels: in-app chat, email support, video tutorials, and a comprehensive help center. Pro users get priority support with responses within 2 hours during business hours.

**Q: Does it work on mobile devices?**
A: Yes! Our web app works perfectly on all devices, and we have native iOS and Android apps coming in Q2 2024. You can upload documents, chat with your AI, and view insights from anywhere.

**Q: What if the AI doesn't understand my question?**
A: Our AI is trained on millions of financial conversations, but if it doesn't understand something, it will ask for clarification or connect you with our human support team. We're constantly improving the AI based on user interactions.
