## System Overview

### Current Implementation Status

The Invenio inventory management system has been implemented as a full-stack web application providing essential inventory management capabilities. The system successfully delivers:

- **Product Management**: Comprehensive product catalog with SKU tracking, pricing, and multi-warehouse inventory levels
- **Order Management**: Both sales and purchase order processing with status tracking and fulfillment workflows
- **Multi-Warehouse Support**: Inventory tracking across multiple warehouse locations with transfer capabilities
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time business intelligence with four specialized analytics sections
- **Reporting System**: Dynamic reports with customizable filters and data visualization
- **User Management**: Role-based access control with secure authentication

### Technology Stack (As Implemented)

#### Frontend
- **Next.js 14.2.3**: React framework with App Router for server-side rendering
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4**: Utility-first styling framework
- **DaisyUI 4.11**: Component library for consistent UI elements
- **Recharts 2.12**: Data visualization for charts and graphs
- **React Hook Form 7.51**: Form state management and validation
- **Heroicons**: Icon library for UI elements

#### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes**: Serverless API endpoints within the same application
- **MongoDB**: Document database for flexible data storage
- **Mongoose 8.4**: MongoDB object modeling with TypeScript support
- **NextAuth.js 4.24**: Authentication with JWT sessions and Google OAuth
- **Stripe**: Payment processing integration (webhook support implemented)
- **Resend**: Email service for notifications

#### Infrastructure
- **Node.js 18+**: Runtime environment
- **Deployment Ready**: Configured for Vercel deployment
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Secure credential management

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Unlike the microservices approach suggested in the original specification, the implementation follows a monolithic architecture within Next.js, simplifying deployment and maintenance.

2. **Document-Oriented Storage**: MongoDB's flexibility is leveraged for storing complex product and order data with embedded relationships where appropriate.

3. **Server-Side Rendering**: Utilizes Next.js App Router for improved SEO and initial page load performance.

4. **API-First Design**: RESTful API endpoints enable potential future mobile app development or third-party integrations.

## Implemented Architecture

### Application Structure

The application follows Next.js 14's App Router structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
app/
├── api/              # RESTful API endpoints
├── dashboard/        # Protected dashboard pages
├── auth/            # Authentication pages
└── (marketing)/     # Public pages

components/          # Reusable React components
models/             # Mongoose schemas
lib/               # Utility functions and configurations
```

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Client-Server Communication**: 
   - React components fetch data via API routes
   - Form submissions use server actions or API endpoints
   - Real-time updates through client-side polling (WebSocket not implemented)

2. **State Management**:
   - Local component state for UI interactions
   - Server state managed through API calls
   - No global state management library (Redux/Zustand not implemented)

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - NextAuth.js handles session management
   - JWT tokens for API authentication
   - Protected routes via middleware

### Database Architecture

The MongoDB implementation uses a hybrid approach:
- **Normalized Collections**: Separate collections for core entities (Products, Customers, Suppliers)
- **Embedded Documents**: Order items embedded within orders for query performance
- **References**: MongoDB ObjectIds maintain relationships between collections
