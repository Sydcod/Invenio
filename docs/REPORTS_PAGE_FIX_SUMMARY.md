# Reports Page Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The Reports page was experiencing instability and errors preventing data generation. Users could access the Reports dashboard but were unable to view actual report data.

## Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue was a mismatch between frontend and backend API routing:
- **Frontend expectation**: Dynamic routes like `/api/reports/${category}/${reportId}`
- **Backend implementation**: Static routes like `/api/reports/sales/by-customer`

The `ReportViewer` component was constructing URLs dynamically but no corresponding dynamic API route handler existed in the backend.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Dynamic API Route Handler
Created new file: `app/api/reports/[category]/[reportId]/route.ts`

This handler:
- Parses incoming requests matching the frontend pattern
- Reconstructs the full report ID by combining category and reportId
- Retrieves report configuration from the registry
- Validates filters and parameters
- Generates reports using `ReportGenerator`
- Handles export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- Transforms response structure to match frontend expectations

### 2. Response Structure Alignment
The frontend `ReportViewer` expects:
```typescript
{
  data: Array<any>,
  pagination: {
    page: number,
    pageSize: number,
    totalPages: number,
    totalItems: number
  },
  summary: Record<string, any>,
  metadata: {
    generatedAt: string,
    filters: Record<string, any>,
    reportName: string
  }
}
```

The dynamic route handler transforms the `ReportGenerator` response to match this structure.

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Lint Error
Changed filter type validation from 'text' to 'search' to align with allowed filter types:
- `dateRange`
- `select`
- `multiSelect`
- `search` (not 'text')
- `number`
- `numberRange`
- `boolean`

## Technical Details

### Key Components
1. **ReportRegistry**: Manages report configurations and IDs
2. **ReportGenerator**: Handles report generation using MongoDB aggregation pipelines
3. **Dynamic Route Handler**: Bridges frontend requests to backend report generation

### Environment
- MongoDB connection string properly configured in `.env`
- Collections contain valid data (`salesorders`, `products`, etc.)
- Next.js API routes for backend
- React components for frontend UI

## Filter Implementation Issues & Solutions

### Issues Discovered
1. **API Route Conflicts**: Legacy static routes (e.g., `/api/reports/inventory/summary`) were intercepting requests before reaching the dynamic handler
2. **Filter Type Mismatches**: Frontend sends single values for select filters, but aggregation pipeline expected arrays
3. **Data Structure Misalignment**: 
   - Category stored as nested object: `category: { name: "Laptops" }`
   - Brand stored as direct string: `brand: "Microsoft"`
   - Both filters used same logic, causing brand filter to fail
4. **Hardcoded Filter Options**: Initial implementation had hardcoded options instead of loading from database

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Dynamic Filter Loading**: Created `/api/reports/filters` endpoint to load all filter options from MongoDB
2. **Filter Type Handling**: Updated aggregation pipeline to handle both single values and arrays:
   ```typescript
   if (params.filters.brand) {
     if (Array.isArray(params.filters.brand) && params.filters.brand.length > 0) {
       matchStage.brand = { $in: params.filters.brand };
     } else if (typeof params.filters.brand === 'string' && params.filters.brand !== '') {
       matchStage.brand = params.filters.brand;
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Proper Field Access**: Use correct paths for nested fields (`category.name` vs `brand`)
4. **Removed Conflicting Routes**: Deleted legacy static route implementations

### Remaining Issues
- Warehouse filter requires complex array field matching with `$elemMatch`
- Need to calculate warehouse-specific stock when filter is applied

## Current Status
✅ Reports dashboard loads correctly
✅ Report categories display properly
✅ Individual reports are accessible
✅ Dynamic API route handles data requests
✅ Export functionality available (CSV, Excel, PDF)
✅ Dynamic filter loading from MongoDB
✅ Category and Brand filters working correctly
⚠️ Warehouse filter needs additional refinement

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any remaining edge cases or error scenarios
2. Implement caching in `ReportGenerator` for performance optimization
3. Add comprehensive error logging for better debugging
4. Consider adding real-time report generation status indicators
5. Enhance filter validation and user feedback
