## Phase 3: Core Application MVP

**Goal:** Build the core product experience: document upload, AI processing, and data visualization.

### Milestone 3.1: Document Management
-   [ ] **Build Dashboard UI (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`):** Create the main layout for logged-in users.
-   [ ] **Build Document Upload UI:** Implement a file dropzone with loading states and progress indicators.
-   [ ] **Build Document Upload API (`/api/documents/upload`):**
    -   [ ] API endpoint to receive file uploads.
    -   [ ] Logic to stream file to Cloudflare R2 for storage.
    -   [ ] Create a `Document` record in MongoDB with `status: 'uploaded'`.
    -   [ ] Add the document processing job to a queue (Upstash Redis).
-   [ ] **Test - Document Upload:** Upload PDF and CSV files. Verify they appear in Cloudflare R2 and a corresponding record is created in MongoDB.

### Milestone 3.2: AI Processing Pipeline
-   [ ] **Create Document Processing Worker:** A serverless function triggered by the Redis queue.
    -   [ ] Fetches the document from R2.
    -   [ ] Implements OCR/parsing logic.
    -   [ ] Calls OpenAI API with a structured prompt to extract transactions.
    -   [ ] Updates document status to `status: 'processing'` then `status: 'complete'` or `status: 'failed'`.
-   [ ] **Save Transactions to DB:** The worker saves the extracted transactions to the `transactions` collection in MongoDB.
-   [ ] **Test - AI Pipeline:** Manually trigger the worker with a sample document. Verify transactions are extracted and saved correctly to the database.

### Milestone 4.1: Conversational AI Assistant
-   [ ] **Build Chat UI:** Create the chat interface components (`ChatInterface.tsx`, `MessageBubble.tsx`, etc.).
-   [ ] **Implement Vector Embeddings:** When processing documents, create and store vector embeddings of transactions (using Pinecone/other) for semantic search.
-   [ ] **Build Chat API (`/api/ai/chat`):**
    -   [ ] Use LangChain.js to create a retrieval chain.
    -   [ ] The chain will take a user's question, find relevant transactions from the vector store, and use an LLM to generate a natural language answer.
-   [ ] **Test - AI Chat:** Ask various questions about spending. Test for accuracy, context awareness, and performance.

### Milestone 4.2: Final Polish & Deployment
-   [ ] **Implement Stripe Payments:** Integrate Stripe Checkout for Pro/Premium subscription tiers.
